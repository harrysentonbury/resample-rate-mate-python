### Resample or change speed of a .wav file

**Well..... it still works!**

It will resample .wav files and even change the speed by whatever reasonable
factor you type in BUT, once you hit go you can't stop it until its finished.
I will probably fix that one day.

It can also just change speed and keep the original sample rate.

```
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install numpy
```
Oh no, I almost forgot tkinter:-

```
sudo apt-get install python-tk
```

...And to run it:

```
python3 resample_rate_mate.py
```
